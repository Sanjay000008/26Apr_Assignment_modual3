#What is Tuple? Difference between List and Tuple

Tuples are used to store multiple items in single variable.
A Tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable.

List:                             Tuple:
1.List are mutable                1. Tuples are immutable
2.Iteraction is Time-             2. Iteraction is comparatively 
  counsuming                         Faster
3.list have several built-        3. Tuple does not have many
  in methods                         built-in methods
  
  The differences between tuples and lists are, the tuples cannot
be changed unlike lists and tuples use parentheses, whereas lists
use square brackets.
